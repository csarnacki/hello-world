# hello-world
My first repository 

My name is Chris and I am looking to become a web developer, focusing on front-end development. The three languages that I have been practicing on for the past year have been HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've also learned a little bit about PHP, Python and React. The vast majority of where I have learned how to code is from Codecademy.
